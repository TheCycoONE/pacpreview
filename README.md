# pacpreview
Helpful unified package info screen for pacman

I was looking for a better info screen to use as the preview window for fzf over the pacman package list.

## Usage
### Standalone
**pacpreview** *package_name*

### With fzf
Add an alias to your bashrc or zshrc file:
```bash
alias pacs="pacman -Slq | fzf --multi --preview 'pacpreview {1}' | xargs -ro sudo pacman -S"
```

Then run:
`pacs`
